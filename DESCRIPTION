Description: Accurate consensus sequence from nanopore reads of a DNA gene library. 
                SINGLe corrects for systematic errors in nanopore sequencing reads of
                gene libraries and it retrieves true consensus sequences of variants
                identified by a barcode, needing only a few reads per variant. More
